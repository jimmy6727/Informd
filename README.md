Included in the initial commit is a machine learning algorithm that uses a SVM classfier to identify whether or not a given sentence is a claim. This will be improved upon and used in our automated analysis of news articles. Initial testing yielded 83% prediction accuracy.

Also included is a script that gets top articles (Ranked by total number of shares on social media) from the EventRegistry news API.
